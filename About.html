            was finished my primary school at my village and then went to the
            high school in urban.When I was finished my high school in 2020 and
            served as a guide immediately.Then in 2021, I went the college that
            was founded by our Shan people and named Kaw Dai Organization.When I
            was there I have learned about the society a lot because at there
            the major is social science.After two years of stayed at there, I
            have got my own new journey and finally came to Thailand.
